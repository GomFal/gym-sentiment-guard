32,Maia Dong,"update i contacted rob, he is really nice. i would like to say a big thank you to rob for understanding this situation and help us! so far, my friend and i in general have wonderful experience with the edge. the reception is always friendly and helpful. i am impressed by rob’s reply and how he deals with our sharing experience. i can feel they work together very well and ensure a friendly and safe environment for members. thank you again to the male staff with black beard this afternoon, you threatened me and my friend to leave because you claimed a workout session with friend is “coaching”. you kept pressing questions for a qualified license to my friend. but we are students and do usual workout here? btw, many couples of friends were doing workout and helping each other at the same time. whatever your truly intentions of your behavior, either for selling your lessons, sexism or else, you already got us attention of your manner, and ruined our experience with the edge. we will further escalate this issue if similar things happen",5,Fecha de edición: Hace un año,en

142,Clara Nascimento-Pillitz,"if you are looking for a personal trainer at the edge gym, to help guide you on your fitness journey, i would highly recommend ali kteich. ali is extremely competent in his field, with extensive knowledge in muscle building and toning, core training, flexibility, boxing and more. today in my first session with him, he assessed me and noticed that i have accumulated tension in my neck and shoulders which is causing pain in my upper and lower back. ali showed me a few effective stretches to do to ease the tension and strengthen the muscles that are currently weak and underworked. he also did pnf stretches to help joint mobility and increase flexibility, as well as some core training. on top of being an excellent personal trainer, ali is very kind, enthusiastic and encouraging. he truly cares about his clients and their wellbeing and because of this, he has gained a lot of respect and credibility for what he does. 5 stars!! need a personal trainer? book a session with ali kteich, i promise you will not regret it!",5,Hace 6 años,en

26,Ittefaq Ahmed Kiani,"certainly! ""the edge"" typically refers to the outermost part of something, often a boundary or border. it can also symbolize the forefront or cutting edge of technology, innovation, or any field. it evokes a sense of adventure, risk-taking, and pushing boundaries. metaphorically, ""living on the edge"" suggests living a daring or unconventional lifestyle.",5,Hace un año,en

8,James Barwick,"what an utter farce this facility (pool) has become! i have to question if the people making the decisions regarding the operation of the pool have spent a significant enough period on deck to make the ludicrous choices we as paying consumers are having to deal with?! why you ask....... (relates particularly to the 0730-0830 saturday and sunday sessions). a period of time where you would wonder if the full compliment of staff would arrive on time to open the pool! numerous pool system failures meaning the pool was never ready for the session to begin, but always for the lessons starting after! sometimes only being let in to the building barely minutes before the session is due to start, so loosing time in the water you are paying for as you are still getting changed. if you are in early enough to change, being let on poolside after the session has already started. extremely poor lane management (it will get worse later in this review!!!!). as slow or poor swimmers are regularly allowed to just jump in a lane doing head up breaststroke where people are swimming at incredible pace, leaving the faster swimmers to have to police. and now we get to the really really ""good"" bits! turn up to sunday session and thr pool that is usually 1.2m deep in the shallow end is now 0.9m. may no seem like a great issue to some, bit when you are as tall as i am it means you can't push off properly and have to severely alter your pull to not take the skin off you fingers. admittedly this did seem to be resolved after speaking to staff for following weeks at the expense of 5 minutes being taken off the session for staff to raise the pool for lessons. however no resulting % reduction in price paid or starting the session 5 minutes earlier to make up! and now the biggest debacle of the lot - the current, what i can only hope is experiment with the lane set up to again better accommodate the set up for the lessons following the session! historically one double lane and the rest of the pool in standard lane set up. now, this ridiculous set up of 2 double lanes sometimes labeled ""fast"". trust me no fast lane swimmer wants to swim in a lane like that. but this has just caused more disruption. people are swimming in no order in those lanes and they regularly dive out of those lanes into the singles lanes that are swimming in order and get in the way! i have in the past 3/4 weeks i have hurt my back avoiding a slower swimmer that should never have been in the lane as they floundered on the wall as i turned. this very morning i was unable to swim at the speed i wanted due to being invaded by someone who was not in the appropriate lane. (poor lane management again). this stupid set up if it continues will lead to accidents if it continues and swimmers i know currently not attending turning up. if i or those i swim with hit someone at full pace because they've jumped in the way, they will probably have to be rescued. people in the massed lanes swimming in no order will collide and i've regularly noticed how bad it is getting. any extra attendance pressure with only make this worse! clearly no attention has been paid to who swims over a significant period. people swimming at that time.on a weekend are serious swimmers, not there to mess around and want proper lanes, not what is currently in place. since returning from covid, prices have risen, service has dropped and now to comically poor levels!. i can say this not just as any other member of the public but a club and lane swimmer, former lifeguard and pool staff and just generally someone with common sense. what was probably the best pool to lane swim/train in within leeds has become, quite frankly a joke! maybe start listening to your customers and give us what we want, not what you think !",1,Hace un mes,en

79,Andy Walsh,good facilities but over-crowded during term time. i've only given it 3 stars because the gym economises by having a membership team trying also to perform a customer service role when they do not have the skills or aptitude for it. as a customer for 10 months i had contact with their management who think they're quite good but to resolve basic membership issues they just deferred to their legal team. no clue. i haven't come across this approach before which is a shame and let's them down.,3,Hace 11 años,en

77,Ali XOXO,the pool isn’t very friendly for slower swimmers. often times i come and those who should be in the fast lane have spread themselves out across all the lanes so they can have 1 each leaving no where for those who need the slow lane. i’d also be willing to go into the double lane at the near end however there is nearly always someone having an unofficial swimming lesson who have spread themselves out across the width of this area meaning you can’t swim a full length or again someone who’s a much better swimmer and should be in the medium/fast lane. as someone who wants to swim slowly and casually for mental health this pool makes that difficult and i’ve often left before i’ve wanted to because i’ve not felt welcome. the lifeguards just sit leaning on their hands looking bored or gossiping on their radios unbothered by any of this,2,Hace 2 años,en

68,Aiysha,"i began to use the edge gym almost 2 months ago by purchasing 20 hours of personal training sessions. unfortunately my timing meant most of my period spent at this gym was within the substituted training room(s) due to the summer refurbishment. that said, the booking system in place at the time for all members meant the limited capacity of gym space was never overcrowded and working out comfortably was still possible. luckily, i managed to spend 2 weeks working out in the newly refurbished gym space which evidently had a lot of thought put into its layout due to its spaciousness and abundance of newly purchased state-of-the-art technogym equipment everywhere. whilst working out, it was great to see staff cleaners walking around disinfecting and cleaning the equipment after use of others. i would definitely recommend the edge gym to others - especially university of leeds students, for which such a facility is an asset. i would also recommend investing in a personal trainer at the edge if you have the means as my experience with aimee lewis was nothing short of lovely. aimee focused on consolidating a strong foundation into my fitness by initially focusing solely on the basics of the mobility and posture required for optimising training at the gym. she then tailored my personal training programme each week to ensure i was both having fun and challenging myself a little more. i did spend a lot of time complaining to her how i hated what she put me through (lol) but i always left my gym sessions feeling so much better - both mentally and physically - each time. my lack of one star in this review is due to the membership options. i never purchased a membership as this was not required for personal training sessions. however, now that i had wanted to use the edge without a personal trainer, i was unhappy to learn the membership options were nothing less than a 3-month direct debit programme. the option of 1-month would’ve been better as i plan on going away soon. the one-off passes are also quite extortionate in my opinion, so do bear that in mind for those of you who are unable to commit.",4,Hace 3 años,en

4,MATTHEW WHITE,"the reception staff at the edge are always very good, welcoming and helpful. however on a different note after swimming yesterday morning for the 7:30 am session (7/9/25), and experiencing the revised lane set out it was a very dissatisfying lane swim. the 7:30 - 8:30 am saturday and sunday swims are supposed to be a lane swim with lanes to segregate swimmers of different abilities. however the removal of 3 lane ropes renders most of the pool as a free for all. and when the students come back and the pool gets busier then lane swimming will be a waste of time. and bearing in mind some very fast swimmers use these sessions there could be some very bad collisions. and to make matters worse, the already limited 1 hour swim (and that’s when swimmers are allowed in on time), has now being been shaved to 55 minutes, which is to enable the children’s swimming lessons to start earlier, bearing in mind these swimming lessons go on for several hours. another annoying aspect, particularly with the saturday swim is that the end lane during the 1 adult swim is hired out for private lane hire / swimming lessons, mainly for young children, often just 1 child in the end lane, which happens to be the widest lane in the pool. so pool space is already limited for the relatively time limited adult swim as it is. all i can say is that management should seriously consider installing all the lane ropes again, reinstating it as a 1 hour session, with the pool roller shutter door open on time and incorporating the private lane hire into the children’s swimming lessons program. ideally the adult 1 hour swim should be extended to 90 mins, with a 7 am start time.",3,Hace 2 meses,en

7,dingsong cui (崔丁松),"what a brilliant system this gym has! silly me—i thought asking a friend to hand me my own membership card right in front of reception would be the most transparent and honest thing to do. but apparently, that’s suspicious behaviour worthy of public questioning. incredible! of course, if someone were really trying to use a membership card that doesn’t belong to them, they’d definitely do it right in front of the reception desk, with cctvs and staff watching. because that’s exactly how criminal masterminds operate, isn’t it? i still don’t know if it’s technically against your rules to have a friend bring my card from my office. but one thing i’ve learned: next time i forget it, i’d better run all the way back and get it myself—otherwise, i might be treated to a truly delightful friday night interrogation. what a way to kick off the weekend! checking membership is your job, and i’m more than happy to cooperate. but barking orders like “don’t stand here” or “don’t stand there,” and speaking to people with unnecessary rudeness—now that’s real customer service. truly, the gentleman at the front desk was the most polite person i’ve ever encountered in the uk. is that also in your staff training manual? really, five stars just don’t do you justice. if i could, i’d give you ten out of five—you’ve clearly redefined customer experience. but since there’s no ten, i guess i’ll have to settle for giving you one.",1,Hace 3 meses,en
