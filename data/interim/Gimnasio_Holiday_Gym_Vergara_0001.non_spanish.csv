290,Yuvraj Singh,"be careful about giving your bank details, they will charge you automatically without letting you know and when you ask for a refund they will provide you with so many conditions instead of just refunding. as a tourist i suggest don’t join this gym or this franchise gym, it’s not going to be a good experience. so not worth it.",1,Hace un año,0.0
291,G V,"not a great gym. compared with cr7 gym which offers much better options and lower prices, what holiday offered didn't sound as a good value for me. the weights and machines were good but small gym with little light inside.",2,Hace 7 años,0.0
292,Gemma Marco,"join for the cheap prices and stay because it's impossible to unsubscribe! had to open a dispute through my bank for the receipts they sent me after i asked to unsubscribe during lockdown. after they renewed my contracts against my will, i went in person and was told to come back another time. thankfully my bank gave me my money back after i showed proof of my many unsuccessful attempts to unsubscribe. it's an interesting business model they have!",1,Fecha de edición: Hace 4 años,0.9916484951972961
293,Deepak Bansal,"subject: urgent attention required i and my wife are members of your holiday gym( principe de vergara, 28016). we had taken the membership of your gym on 29th august 2017 for 3months. we had no idea that our membership was on autorenewal since we are outsiders from spain. it is very unfortunate to inform you that your staff had not explained us the rules regarding autorenewal and had not sent us any contract copy inspite of many reminders . ( if you have sent us a mail , please provide a proof of the same ) when i informed your staff that we want to discontinue because we are going back to our country, he denied to stop the autorenewal. i informed him 10days before the end of subscription (20th november 2017). and since no one told me about the rules, i couldn't do it within the specified time as per your rules. now that new month (december) has started, holiday gym has deducted our entire fees for the next three months.(and we are leaving spain). kindly tell me why despite asking you to stop our autosubscription, it was not done? i was not even told to inform higher authorities or any administration regarding the matter. infact even after informing you that i want to discontinue, it seems that holiday gym wants to force me to remain subscribed unnecessarily. i have no words to express how i have felt. i regret taking a membership here. and now i am asking them for a solution and they are saying the same thing that i should have informed them within 19th of a month. it is a sheer harasment. well whatever the fact is, i have been charged for a service which i have not availed and also can not because i am going back. but still i have to pay for it. i would request you to kindly look into the matter and let me know why such an irresponsibility took place that they never sent me any contract copy or informed regarding any rules? we are looking forward for a refund about this irresponsible and unjust behaviour from your side.",1,Hace 8 años,0.979586124420166
294,Justyna,"i do recommend this place at all - the staff is rude, gives incorrect information. and those days (january 2023) it is really cold inside. they do not put any heating even in changing room or corridors. disaster",1,Hace 2 años,0.0
