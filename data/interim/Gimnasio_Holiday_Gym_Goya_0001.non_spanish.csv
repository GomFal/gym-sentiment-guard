390,Iliya Rad,"“the worst gym i have ever experienced in my life. i absolutely do not recommend it to anyone. they charge the highest fees but offer the least — not even basic respect or personal rights, especially toward foreigners. i’m deeply disappointed with the poor management. customers’ rights are completely ignored, and everything seems to be only for their close friends.”",1,Hace 5 meses,0.0
391,Beatriz Barretto,"the cancellation policy for the gym is an absolute joke. you cant cancel after the 5th of the month prior. scammy gym with unhelpful staff. definitely not worth the price for such shitty customer service. they just want to rip people off at every opportunity, if you forget your bracelet you have to pay to go in, if you need to reactivate your bracelet you have to pay. ok equipment, terrible staff and even worse policies. stay away!",1,Hace 7 meses,0.9621200561523438
392,Tommaso Pigatti,"since i don’t live in madrid, this is the second month that i send them the email to cancel my subscription through the website, but they simply don’t answer and then they tell you that you have to pay again because their system can cancel subscription only between the 1st and the 5th of the month (and i sent the email to cancel in those days!). ridicoli",1,Hace 5 meses,0.0
393,Veronika Akrackova,"had to call the police and filed complaint with consumers office i went there once and got a badge for 12€ and a day pass for a week which costs 39€. back then the process was tedious and complex but the employees tried their best and were helpful. since i regularly come to madrid i wanted to purchase another day pass for the account i previously created with this gym. unfortunately this time i came across an employee that was just bitter. after telling this person that i am a member already and showing my bracelet they didn’t ask for my name. instead they persisted that there is no system and i cannot be in there. for whatever reason i had to give them my passport number. so i went back home and got my passport. returned and this person set up a new account for me, charged me the 39€ for the day pass. i thought that would be it. they did as well. but when i tried to walk in with my bracelet it didn’t work. because it was tied to the account i initially opened with them. after a phone call this employee tells me that i need to pay for the bracelet. i wondered „but it’s already mine i paid for it the first time“. if you didn’t know (because it doesn’t say anywhere), you have to pay a reactivation fee to be able to use the bracelet again. that was strange because the people in front of me didn’t have to do that. so when they charge you for the daypass you cannot use it and have to pay subscription on a bracelet. after they told me that i just felt scammed and didn’t want to stay there anymore. i requested a refund which this employee couldn’t authorise or give me a receipt for. there was nothing they could do (apparently) and i would have to come back after the weekend. so i called the police - because that’s illegal. after the two officers showed up it was suddenly possible to send me a receipt via email and send proof of the refund processing. but when i asked for that before it was an impossible request. don’t be scared to stand your ground, be respectful, and get your money back. the police is very helpful call them for support! they have suggested to file a report with the consumers office of madrid and helped me fill out the form. this is not the first time they get called for it.",1,Hace un año,0.0
394,Ross O'Sullivan,"i don't live in madrid anymore and i have moved to valencia where there are no holiday gyms, so i emailed on august 2nd to cancel my contract. they renewed my contract and charged me anyway. a total scam! as mentioned already, the gym is far too warm and most of the equipment is damaged. well, it was before the summer when i still lived in madrid. as a response to your reply... you can see from my photo, there was an email on 2nd of august. total scam! the app barely ever works too.",1,Fecha de edición: Hace 2 años,0.9870597720146179

396,Jeroen van den Boogaard,"cheaters! you can only come to the gym physically to cancel your subscription, but they don’t tell you on the phone that there is a special schedule to do this. so when you arrive, they can’t help you and you have to come back another time. additionally, you can’t cancel monthly, i.e. if you have a 3-month subscription, you can only cancel until the 5th of the month, and otherwise they charge you for another 3 months dont go here!",1,Hace un año,0.0

398,Nicholas Dyer,"thinking about signing up for holiday gym? don’t. 1) they are expensive. 2) they auto renew your membership without notifying you. 3) they have awful customer service. i never leave a negative review unless it’s been a truly awful experience. here’s my story : i signed up for their gym. i told them, i can only live in madrid for a temporary period of time. i specifically said, i want to pay for only 6 months. if i stay longer, i’ll come back to the staff counter and pay again for 3 months. checked my bank account and $300 magically disappeared. turns out, they automatically charged me for a 6 month membership without a call, email, text or anything. i called and i tried to explain with my subpar spanish. then i had my girlfriend, who is native to madrid, call and explain. they refused to refund the money. i’m here until july. i wouldn’t mind renewing for 3 months but instead with this 6 month automatic renewal, i’ll be paying for august, september, october and i won’t even be living here. that makes 0 sense. horrible customer service. shady business practices. try being transparent with your customers, rather than scamming them and maybe you’ll keep more.",1,Hace 6 años,0.9556295871734619
399,Kasper Roldsgaard,"i cannot recommend holiday gym. their cancellation policy is absurd. the cancellation period is restricted to a specific week and must be done in presence within restricted office hours. so, if you move to a different city or county you can't cancel your contact. therefore, i recommend other people not to sign up to holiday gym, because they don't let you leave.",1,Hace 5 años,0.9586836099624634
