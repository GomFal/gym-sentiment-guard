512,Javier Restrepo,"i’ve been a member at david lloyd serrano (madrid) for some time now, and i’m honestly very disappointed with how the gym is being managed lately. cleanliness and organization at opening: every single morning when the gym opens, the workout area is not cleaned or organized. plates / discs are scattered, dumbbells are misplaced, and the floor is visibly dirty. this is completely unacceptable — opening time should mean the gym is ready for members, not that we have to train around yesterday’s mess. i’ve raised this issue directly with the manager on several occasions, but all i ever get are standard, templated replies with no actual change or follow-through. it’s a basic expectation for a club of this supposed standard, and yet it’s consistently ignored. removal of key equipment without notice: recently, management decided — without any communication to members — to remove several pieces of essential equipment from the main workout area, including hexagonal dumbbells, kettlebells, and medballs. these items were used daily by many members and were a crucial part of the free-training area. removing them without warning or explanation has negatively affected everyone’s training experience. it shows a complete lack of consideration for the paying members who rely on that equipment. the equipment should be brought back. at this level of membership pricing, one expects professional management, proper maintenance, and transparent communication. unfortunately, none of those standards are being met right now. unless there is a serious change in how this gym is run, i cannot recommend david lloyd serrano to anyone expecting quality, consistency, or accountability.",1,Hace un mes,0.0

520,Tomas Braz Bava,"david lloyd serrano has been a disappointing experience and not at all worth the high price. they promise top-tier facilities and a high-end experience, but what you actually get is an overcrowded, overpriced nightmare that traps you in a never-ending subscription scam. overcrowded at all hours – no matter what time you go, the gym is always packed, making it nearly impossible to use machines or find space to work out comfortably. for a gym that charges €150 per month, you’d expect better crowd management, but it feels more like a budget gym during peak hours—except it’s always peak hours here. difficult to cancel membership – be very careful before signing up, because canceling is extremely difficult. they rarely pick up the phone, emails go unanswered, and the process is unnecessarily complicated. many members, including myself, have struggled to stop payments even after following their cancellation procedure. customer service needs improvement – the staff is not particularly helpful and can come across as dismissive when you ask for assistance. for a premium-priced gym, i expected a much better level of service. not worth the cost – the facilities do not justify the price tag. basic-fit, which is one of the most affordable gyms in madrid, offers a similar or even better experience for a fraction of the price. overall, i dont recommend this gym based on my experience. there are better options in madrid that offer more value for money and a smoother customer experience.",1,Hace 8 meses,0.9620366096496582

543,Lau MP888,"i’m writing this review after several incidents to express my deep dissatisfaction with the experiences my friend and i have had at the david lloyd club in serrano. while the gym's facilities are satisfactory (though old/in need of maintenance), the behaviour of certain staff members and the handling of memberships have been deeply concerning and unprofessional. firstly, my friend and i joined the gym in the summer of 2023, taking advantage of a summer membership discount. despite this, the gym has repeatedly attempted to charge my friend for an annual membership he never signed up for, demanding an outrageous sum of 3000 euros. this ongoing issue has caused significant stress and inconvenience, particularly as my friend, a venezuelan national, feels unfairly targeted. in contrast, i, a spanish national, have had no such issues with my payments. this discrepancy raises questions about the club's integrity and the fairness of its practices. secondly, an incident involving a pilates instructor has left a lasting negative impression. this instructor - ana, unprofessionally threw a tantrum in front of other students when i went to thank her after her class, simply because i unfollowed her on instagram. to add to this, she rescinded her class invitation to me, despite having already completed said class and having previously confirmed my participation in writing. such childish and unprofessional behaviour from a staff member is entirely surprising and unacceptable. additionally, when i went to reception to inform them of this situation and to pay for my pilates class, a staff member (blonde woman), was unnecessarily unpleasant about the whole situation. at least i was not made to pay for the class, tysm, but her attitude is far from what one would expect from a healthcare provider, contributing to an overall toxic environment at the club. while david lloyd club may boast okay-ish facilities, the toxic behaviour from staff and mishandling of memberships are unacceptable. there are plenty of competitors offering better price points, superior facilities, and kinder, more professional staff. i would not recommend david lloyd club to anyone seeking a positive and respectful gym experience and urge you to read the rest of the negative reviews before joining.",1,Hace un año,0.9674152731895447
544,David Diez,"i have been a david lloyd member for 26 years - the bulk of that membership at a number of their fantastic uk facilities. when i moved to madrid for work, i was excited to learn that they had a facility in the centre of the city. however, i can categorically say, as an avid gym goer, that it is one of the worst gyms that i have ever been to - certainly considering how expensive it is. poor, old, unkept equipment, uninterested staff and unacceptably overpriced - the list could go on… this gym is nowhere near the standard of other david lloyd gyms, and its poor management is detrimental to the brand that i have been such a fan of for so many years. i am unfortunately tied into the contract for a whole year, but as soon as it expires i will be going elsewhere. this is the first and only time that i have ever left a review on google, and it was never my intention to do this - i was just going to leave the gym and leave it there. but after i learned today from my wife (who is also a member) that during the summer you pay full price despite there being fewer classes as staff are on holiday, and that you can’t even freeze your membership, i felt the need to speak up. it’s interesting to see a lot of similar reviews from others… i hope that the senior management see this and implement the necessary changes. i know that in the uk that this would not be acceptable. ********************* update (19th august 2024): almost four weeks have passed since my review on google - david lloyd were quick to respond after a few days (see below) saying that they appreciate the feedback, are sorry and that management would reach out directly to sort things out. i am still waiting for management, or anyone for that matter, to reach out. another example of just how little these people care about the brand, and more importantly, their customers. ********************* update (9th october 2024): 7 weeks have passed since my last update (on the 19th august) and i am yet to receive any correspondence - despite them responding on my first post that they would reach out… almost 3 months since said first post. they literally don’t care about their customers - embarrassing and can’t wait to leave when the 12 months is up.",1,Fecha de edición: Hace un año,0.0
