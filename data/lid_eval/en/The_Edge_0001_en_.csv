2,Chris R,"It's impossibly busy during term time.  Even with a premium membership it's difficult to get through a workout at any reasonable time of day. Gym users don't have basic etiquette (putting back weights, getting in the way of those lifting, just generally wandering around aimlessly), classes are poorly scheduled and take up much more space than they need, and it's getting dangerous.  The mirrors are terribly placed and designed for style rather than checking your form which is their actual purpose. We know that zoomers use the gym as a social place for some reason, but this isn't a nightclub and the gym space must adapt to this.  The staff are very friendly and do appreciate these issues. It's also becoming impossible to book classes and those that you can book are often overfull with people just showing up without a ticket.   Hopefully management will give them resource to expand.",2,Hace 3 semanas,en
3,Jasse Parker,"This is a nice place for many physical exercises and activities.
I go there regularly for playing and sport activities.
The cost for membership is quite high for external people. The EDGE needs to come up with a different plan. People really struggle to pay for its facilities and they don't use all of them. For me, the next plan should be to have a membership plan for each facility and keep adding on top of them.
They have a gym and many other facilities for example, squash, swimming, basketball, badminton, indoor football, cricket, climbing etc. booking required for any of these ones.
They also gave a nice place for socializing and if you wish to sit and chit chat.
Parking is a big issue! And it is paid. Although, it is a big parking area, it is also used by Leeds University people and hence super busy all the time and hard to find a parking space. Because of the parking cost, it makes the visit even more expensive for external visitors. Other than that, it has wheelchair accessibility. 6 electric cars charging socket and all functioning. If you are lucky you might find one of them free.
People are nice and friendly. They do have gym or swimming trainers as well.",5,Fecha de edición: Hace 10 meses,en
4,MATTHEW WHITE,"The reception staff at the Edge are always very good, welcoming and helpful.
However on a different note after swimming yesterday morning for the 7:30 am session (7/9/25), and experiencing the revised lane set out it was a very dissatisfying lane swim.  The 7:30 - 8:30 am Saturday and Sunday swims are supposed to be a lane swim with lanes to segregate swimmers of different abilities.  However the removal of 3 lane ropes renders most of the pool as a free for all.  And when the students come back and the pool gets busier then lane swimming will be a waste of time.  And bearing in mind some very fast swimmers use these sessions there could be some very bad collisions.  And to make matters worse, the already limited 1 hour swim (and that’s when swimmers are allowed in on time), has now being been shaved to 55 minutes, which is to enable the children’s swimming lessons to start earlier, bearing in mind these swimming lessons go on for several hours.  Another annoying aspect, particularly with the Saturday swim is that the end lane during the 1 adult swim is hired out for private lane hire / swimming lessons, mainly for young children, often just 1 child in the end lane, which happens to be the widest lane in the pool.  So pool space is already limited for the relatively time limited adult swim as it is.  All I can say is that management should seriously consider installing all the lane ropes again, reinstating it as a 1 hour session, with the pool roller shutter door open on time and incorporating the private lane hire into the children’s swimming lessons program.  Ideally the adult 1 hour swim should be extended to 90 mins, with a 7 am start time.",3,Hace 2 meses,en

6,Elspeth Mitchell,"I trained with Abi at The Edge in Leeds for several months and can’t recommend her highly enough. She built a programme that really supported me to develop strength, but just as importantly, she gave me confidence in the gym. Abi’s sessions were motivating, thoughtful and tailored to my needs, and she struck the perfect balance of encouragement and challenge. Thanks to her, I feel stronger and more assured in my training than I ever have before.",5,Hace 2 meses,en
7,dingsong cui (崔丁松),"What a BRILLIANT system this gym has! SILLY me—I thought asking a friend to hand me my OWN membership card right in front of reception would be the most transparent and honest thing to do. But apparently, that’s suspicious behaviour worthy of public questioning. Incredible!

Of course, if someone were really trying to use a membership card that doesn’t belong to them, they’d definitely do it right in front of the reception desk, with CCTVs and staff watching. Because that’s exactly how criminal masterminds operate, isn’t it?

I still don’t know if it’s technically against your rules to have a friend bring my card from my office. But one thing I’ve learned: next time I forget it, I’d better run all the way back and get it myself—otherwise, I might be treated to a truly delightful Friday night interrogation. What a way to kick off the weekend!

Checking membership is your job, and I’m more than happy to cooperate. But barking orders like “don’t stand here” or “don’t stand there,” and speaking to people with unnecessary rudeness—now that’s real customer service. Truly, the gentleman at the front desk was the most polite person I’ve ever encountered in the UK. Is that also in your staff training manual?

Really, five stars just don’t do you justice. If I could, I’d give you ten out of five—you’ve clearly redefined customer experience. But since there’s no ten, I guess I’ll have to settle for giving you one.",1,Hace 3 meses,en
8,James Barwick,"What an utter farce this facility (pool) has become!
I have to question if the people making the decisions regarding the operation of the pool have spent a significant enough period on deck to make the ludicrous choices we as paying consumers are having to deal with?!

Why you ask.......
(Relates particularly to the 0730-0830 Saturday and Sunday sessions).

A period of time where you would wonder if the Full compliment of staff would arrive on time to open the pool!

Numerous pool system failures meaning the pool was never ready for the session to begin, but always for the lessons starting after!

Sometimes only being let in to the building barely minutes before the session is due to start, so loosing time in the water you are paying for as you are still getting changed.

If you are in early enough to change, being let on poolside after the session has already started.

Extremely poor lane management (it will get worse later in this review!!!!). As slow or poor swimmers are regularly allowed to just jump in a lane doing head up breaststroke where people are swimming at incredible pace, leaving the faster swimmers to have to police.

And now we get to the really really ""good"" bits!

Turn up to Sunday session and thr pool that is usually 1.2m deep in the shallow end is now 0.9m. May no seem like a great issue to some, bit when you are as tall as I am it means you can't push off properly and have to severely alter  your pull to not take the skin off you fingers.

Admittedly this did seem to be resolved after speaking to staff for following weeks at the expense of 5 minutes being taken off the session for staff to raise the pool for lessons.
However no resulting % reduction in price paid or starting the session 5 minutes earlier to make up!

And now the biggest debacle of the lot - the current, what I can only hope is experiment with the lane set up to again better accommodate the set up for the lessons following the session!

Historically one double lane and the rest of the pool in standard lane set up.
Now, this ridiculous set up of 2 double lanes sometimes labeled ""fast"". Trust me no fast lane swimmer wants to swim in a lane like that.
But this has just caused more disruption.  People are swimming in no order in those lanes and they regularly dive out of those lanes into the singles lanes that are swimming in order and get in the way!
I have in the past 3/4 weeks I have hurt my back avoiding a slower swimmer that should never have been in the lane as they floundered on the wall as I turned. This very morning I was unable to swim at the speed I wanted due to being invaded by someone who was not in the appropriate lane. (Poor lane management again).
This stupid set up if it continues will lead to accidents if it continues and swimmers I know currently not attending turning up.
If I or those I swim with hit someone at full pace because they've jumped in the way, they will probably have to be rescued.  People in the massed lanes swimming in no order will collide and I've regularly noticed how bad it is getting. Any extra attendance pressure with only make this worse!

Clearly no attention has been paid to who swims over a significant period. People swimming at that time.on a weekend are serious swimmers, not there to mess around and want proper lanes, not what is currently in place.

Since returning from covid, prices have risen, service has dropped and now to comically poor levels!.

I can say this not just as any other member of the public but a club and lane swimmer, former lifeguard and pool staff and just generally someone with common sense.
What was probably the best pool to lane swim/train in within Leeds has become, quite frankly a joke!

Maybe start listening to your customers and give us what we want, not what you think !",1,Hace un mes,en
9,Merve Durmaz,"Bad experience here today (13th July). I arrived around 12:45 to get changed ready to swim when the pool was supposed to open at 1pm. It was empty without staff when I arrived, although there were supposed to be lessons on, but there were no signs indicating that it was out of order. I got changed and waited past 1pm but no one came to open it. In the end, only when we asked were we informed that there was an issue with the chlorine pump so it was out of use. But the receptionist had watched 2 of us enter the changing room without saying anything. A sign or blocking the entrance (which they subsequently did) would have been really useful.",1,Fecha de edición: Hace 4 meses,en

The ample parking is free to the public after 5pm and weekends - don't chance it as ANPR is in use.

I was only visiting for a short while and so purchased 12 visits for £80. Other gyms in the area (Total Fitness) wanted a minimum 3 week membership plus a bunch of joining/admin fees which would have come out at £180.",5,Hace 7 años,en
11,尹兰馨,"I had a disappointing experience but the edge team sorted it fast. I have been a student in uni of Leeds and I've kept buying edge membership even after graduation. It's been great dealing with the edge and spending time playing volleyball. Until 09/07/2025, I called in to book a volleyball court and that lady just went straight away to ask me do it online coz she is busy. I get it and I'm happy to do it online if I can, but I can't as your system wouldn't allow me do it online for volleyball. Because volleyball takes up three badminton courts and the system is not upgraded enough to do that yet. And I explained,  that lady went straight away, if you can't do it online it means you can't book. Please ma'am I've been doing this for a whole year would you learn more about your job and system first maybe？If not its fine we can still make it work together but at least not be rude？It's so awful, ruined my day. I emailed The Edge to raise the issue, and their team responded quickly and professionally with support and a clear explanation.

She was very good with teaching me how to use equipment I had never used before and whenever I felt tired or overwhelmed ,she would stop and  try to make the workout easier for me.

19,Matthew Walker,"Upgraded review to 5 star, as the situation below regarding the pool and sauna is resolved!

Overall the gym is pretty good, I'm happy with the equipment and cleanliness. However, the big issue for me is that if you would like to use the sauna or steam room you HAVE to book a swim lane. I don't even want to go for a swim, and wouldn't like take a swimming spot from someone else. So because of this rule and the low swimming lane spots it's also difficult to actually book a swim lane even if I wanted to. The reception staff said this was a management decision.

The person I spoke to assured me that the pitch would be open.

However, when I arrived at 9:00 PM, a different staff member at the reception informed me that the pitch was unavailable due to the weather conditions.

Came to have a look round and see what was available pool wise as my arthritis is becoming more severe and Firmin could not have been more helpful. Same when Surinder who called me back today as I had left a voice mail with the Edge a couple of days ago. Both were very informative and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. Sadly for a 60yr old lady the mixed sex changing room arrangements in the pool area is a bit daunting and it was extremely hectic when I was there with the majority of changers being male. The female only changing room are ok but it only has lockers and one  hairdryer... so will just dry/ change and shower at home.  Not A1 clean but far superior to the Leeds City Council pools I've been to see (all of which were very dirty and smelly). Firmin did advise of the other female changing rooms on the other side of the building however that would mean walking in a costume all the way past the studios/ squash courts / reception to the pool.... I can't do that.
I am going to try Aqua sessions (bookable on line) and the 'women - only' sessions in the pool and see how I go.",4,Hace un año,en
31,Paul,"I think for being run by the university, it should be cheaper. But staff are great, the pool is great... actually I don't understand complaints about the water temperature, it's warmer than most pools I've been in. Just take a cold shower before. Actually, the swimming pool seems overstaffed, there are constantly at least two lifeguards even if there are hardly any swimmers. One would be enough. The gym should have an additional pullup machine, there is only one, and it's always in use. Sometimes the music is a bit loud. I usually love the music selection, but sometimes I still listen to podcasts or my own music. I also see many (most?) others walking around with headphones, so by blasting the music so loudly you make us use our headphones at a higher volume, which is not great for our hearing. Lastly, the sauna isn't hot enough because it's a small room and every few minutes someone opens the door to get in or out, so it cools down quite quickly. I guess that's unavoidable though. Everything else is great.
Edit: soon after my review, the music volume was reduced a lot. I hope you didn't make that decision purely based on my review, it almost makes me feel guilty. However, I trust you enquired with others and reached the same conclusion. Sorry for not reaching out to you, but I prefer to remain pseudonymous in my review.",4,Fecha de edición: Hace 11 meses,en

To the male staff with black beard this  afternoon, you threatened me and my friend to leave because you claimed a workout session with friend is “coaching”.

Downside: It is REALLY busy during term time, so I understand the booking system to use the sauna, but it’s pretty annoying (they didn’t used to have this before Covid). The fact that a lost card costs £5 when you pay nearly £50 per month is also a joke. I don’t understand why they can’t use a QR code on the phone like most other gyms do (without issue).

The gym offers a variety of equipment. Equipment that you will propably will not find in conventional gyms.
Staff is very helpful and polite.
Male changing rooms and showers are clean.
Swimming pool is in good condition along with the steam room and sauna.
Swimming pool timetable is balanced and although the pool can get busy you can still do your workout.

Cons:
The gym is very busy. I use the gym 6/7 days around noon and it is ALWAYS packed. Can’t get a rack for weights or space to do body exercises/sit ups/ etc.
You have to wait to use any machine 90% of the time.

What sets him apart is his unwavering commitment to safety. Throughout every session, I felt well-protected as he closely monitored my form and provided corrections when needed. It's evident that safety is a top priority, allowing me to push my limits confidently.

I've learned so much and am genuinely thrilled with the progress I've made. If you're looking for a knowledgeable, experienced, and safety-conscious personal trainer, look no further – I highly recommend Slavi Slavov.

68,Aiysha,"I began to use The Edge Gym almost 2 months ago by purchasing 20 hours of personal training sessions.

Unfortunately my timing meant most of my period spent at this gym was within the substituted training room(s) due to the summer refurbishment. That said, the booking system in place at the time for all members meant the limited capacity of gym space was never overcrowded and working out comfortably was still possible. Luckily, I managed to spend 2 weeks working out in the newly refurbished gym space which evidently had a lot of thought put into its layout due to its spaciousness and abundance of newly purchased state-of-the-art Technogym equipment everywhere. Whilst working out, it was great to see staff cleaners walking around disinfecting and cleaning the equipment after use of others. I would definitely recommend The Edge Gym to others - especially University of Leeds students, for which such a facility is an asset.

I would also recommend investing in a personal trainer at The Edge if you have the means as my experience with Aimee Lewis was nothing short of lovely. Aimee focused on consolidating a strong foundation into my fitness by initially focusing solely on the basics of the mobility and posture required for optimising training at the gym. She then tailored my personal training programme each week to ensure I was both having fun and challenging myself a little more. I did spend a lot of time complaining to her how I hated what she put me through (lol) but I always left my gym sessions feeling so much better - both mentally and physically - each time.

My lack of one star in this review is due to the membership options. I never purchased a membership as this was not required for personal training sessions. However, now that I had wanted to use The Edge without a personal trainer, I was unhappy to learn the membership options were nothing less than a 3-month direct debit programme. The option of 1-month would’ve been better as I plan on going away soon. The one-off passes are also quite extortionate in my opinion, so do bear that in mind for those of you who are unable to commit.",4,Hace 3 años,en
69,cap 413,"Great facilities for people wanting to do cardio - very poor for people wanting to strength train - specifically people who are wanting to start a weight training regime with lighter weights than the 20kg bar. There are only four fixed barbells, one is 15kg. Only one smith machine which is always broken.
Poor layout - the only mirrors are at one end behind the free weights. There's no space to work out in front of them. The 'freestyle' area is full of equipment, no mirrors, all equipment is against the wall so people are constantly walking across your mat when you're working out. Just badly thought out.
I joined to try out the classes but they are constantly full. You are told to ring up at 6am 48 hrs before and book on - consequently I've not been able to get onto any of the popular classes. I think perhaps a waiting system would be a fairer way of allowing all people to enjoy the classes.

77,Ali XOXO,The pool isn’t very friendly for slower swimmers. Often times I come and those who should be in the fast lane have spread themselves out across all the lanes so they can have 1 each leaving no where for those who need the slow lane. I’d also be willing to go into the double lane at the near end however there is nearly always someone having an unofficial swimming lesson who have spread themselves out across the width of this area meaning you can’t swim a full length or again someone who’s a much better swimmer and should be in the medium/fast lane. As someone who wants to swim slowly and casually for mental health this pool makes that difficult and I’ve often left before I’ve wanted to because I’ve not felt welcome.

He is hoping to develop boxing in the Edge to create a potential boxing society come the new year which I would love to be involved in. I’d highly recommend Ali to anyone especially if you want fast results and willing to work hard.",5,Hace 6 años,en

Ali is extremely competent in his field, with extensive knowledge in muscle building and toning, core training, flexibility, boxing and more. Today in my first session with him, he assessed me and noticed that I have accumulated tension in my neck and shoulders which is causing pain in my upper and lower back. Ali showed me a few effective stretches to do to ease the tension and strengthen the muscles that are currently weak and underworked. He also did PNF stretches to help joint mobility and increase flexibility, as well as some core training. On top of being an excellent personal trainer, Ali is very kind, enthusiastic and encouraging. He truly cares about his clients and their wellbeing and because of this, he has gained a lot of respect and credibility for what he does. 5 stars!! Need a personal trainer?
