378,Scott Asling,"the gyms is quite good but it’s far too busy all the time, equipment regularly breaks and takes a long time to fix, and the ceilings are often leaking leading to mould on the walls. the cleaning is also terrible. i saw the same rubbish under the free weights for several days. i think that for profiting this gym has too many members. also with the day pass members this worsens the situation. it’s not really enjoyable and is quite unfair on members. over the years i have endured being a member there are cockroaches, dirt and dust, broken machines, dangerously ceilings, mould and leaks. photos attached. i hope that altafit can focus on paying customer satisfaction by signing up only a fair number of members to the club, restricting guests and making sure the safety and equipment of the club is satisfactory. worth noting that the desk staff are very friendly; no complaints there.",2,Hace 9 meses,0.9809355139732361
379,YAFEA ALYAFEI,"i was looking for a gym during my stay in madrid. and this was my best option. the location is perfect. it was just 2 minutes walking distance from my hotel. the place is huge and they have a day pass, which is perfect for someone like me as a visitor. the price was great and the staff were nice and friendly. i highly recommend it. it's located in sol.",5,Hace 10 meses,0.0
380,Edward Au,"the equipments are good, especially for cross fit training. there are also decent number of kettlebells of up to 28kg. would love that they can have a few heavier ones! i am a visitor and it is kind of self-service to buy their day passes via their tablets at the counter. if you do not know spanish, remember to have a translator installed in your phone as it helps. once you registered, and followed their instructions to install an app, then you can use the qr code generated from the app to enter and exit the gym, and use the app to buy additional day passes.",5,Hace 2 meses,0.0
381,Chris Noble-Beeck,"while i value the positive aspects of the gym, including the staff's friendliness, the camaraderie among members, and the quality of the classes offered (particularly the boxing club), some significant areas require attention. the facility's limitations, such as the size, the age of the equipment, and the lack of planned renovations, are concerning. furthermore, the absence of enforced gym etiquette, specifically regarding the re-racking of weights, creates a frustrating environment for other members. the trainers' willingness to assist all members is commendable. however, the behavior of certain individuals, who disregard basic gym courtesy, negatively impacts the overall experience. given the high demand for equipment, strategic workout timing and alternative exercises are advisable. the recent acquisition by a competitor and the implementation of a qr code entry system are noted. the ongoing renovations, particularly the repainting of the lower level, are observed. the staff remains consistently pleasant. we trust that the company will consider acquiring new equipment, potentially replacing existing machinery with updated models and introducing essential additions. furthermore, we are experiencing increasing dissatisfaction with the behavior of new gym members who disregard established protocols, such as failing to re-rack weights, which necessitates a corrective action plan. implementing clear rules and consequences for non-compliance is essential. a tiered system of penalties, including a one-day suspension for the first offense, a one-week suspension for the second, and a one-month suspension for the third, culminating in permanent expulsion for a fourth infraction, is recommended. it is imperative to foster a culture of shared responsibility and respect within the gym environment. we urge viva gym to address this issue proactively, as it is unacceptable for patrons to maintain the facility's cleanliness and order more effectively than the staff. regarding recent developments, we have learned that the current manager, who has been instrumental in maintaining the gym's operations despite limited resources, is being transferred to a viva gym location in a less desirable area. this decision is concerning, given her significant contributions to the company. it is recommended that the company recognize her exceptional performance and consider her for a managerial position, rather than appointing an external candidate. the previous management structure included two managers, and the current manager has consistently demonstrated the same level of dedication and effectiveness as her counterpart. moreover, the issue of members failing to re-rack equipment and maintain a civil environment persists, requiring further attention.",1,Hace un mes,0.9487118124961853

403,Svk Svk,"nice gym, friendly and enthusiastic trainers. they were able to offer a month to month membership during our two month stay in madrid. the gym is very centrally located 2 mins from plaza del sol & the metro. we easily walked from a few different neighborhoods during our stay. like a lot of gyms there is plenty equipment during non peak hours, but it gets a little too crowded in the early evenings... when’s it’s hard to get an open bench or hop on the machine you need. but we easily came earlier or later once we figured this out. also taking a spin class during this time wouldn’t be a bad idea. the space offers a weight room with free weights, many machines (a few outstanding ones, i quite liked), a functional training area with two squat racks and bumper plates, a large cardio room, spin room and an upstairs group room. they offer several daily spin classes, zumba, power zumba (on wednesday’s), g-box as well as several others. we actually found the power zumba to be quite fun cardio! the fee worked out to about 60€ per person per month. thank you myst for being a solid workout option during our stay, we will look you back up the next time we are in town!",5,Hace 6 años,0.0
